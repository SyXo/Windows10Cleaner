By default, when you install Windows 10, it comes with loads of preloaded software and settings that you may not want.
In fact, all of these tend to increase something that is called the [input lag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_lag), and eating your CPU power in the background.
The goal of the project is to tweak your operating system to get it as responsive as possible.
