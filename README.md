By default, when you install Windows 10, it comes with loads of preloaded software and settings that you may not want.
In fact, all of these tend to increase something that is called the [input lag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_lag). The more there is, the more time there is between the action you perform, and its display.
The goal of the project is to tweak your operating system to get it as responsive as possible.

I didn't event anything, and I am very much based on these people :
